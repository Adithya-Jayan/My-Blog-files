## Mentors

* Aditya Jayan
* A Shrikant

* Naman

## Objectives

This project aims at recognizing a handwritten text and replicating the same in a different handwriting. The work was then devided to
* Segmentation of the text into individual characters.
* Design and train a machine learning model to recognize the handwritten characters.
* Design a system to recreate the text in adifferent handwriting.

Each of the objectives were specifically handled by both of the team members.

## Methodology

### Segmentation of the text to letters

The handwritten text was to be captured by a camera and made available for processing it digitally. The image obtained was then processed to obtain a 
low-noise binary thresholded image of the same text.

The algorithm used for segmentation was called a 'Projection  Profile'.
