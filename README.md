# Deep Space 1: How and what does it do on Space??
Deep Space 1 or DS1 is a satellite launched by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in 1998 to serve its purpose as a technology demonstration spacecraft. It was launched to test various upcoming technologies in space, its conditions, outcomes, threats or limitations of the proposed technology etc. in real time in space rather than earthly simulations.
We are interested to learn how DS1 or any satellite in outer space carry out efficient communications to Space stations in Earth. For this, we must first be aware of Deep Space Network (DSN).
## Deep Space Network
Deep Space Network is a network of large antennas positioned in Earth to capture various signals from the spacecrafts, used to provide scientific data, instructions to spacecraft, health of the spacecraft etc. NASA has positioned three antennas on three locations on Earth, namely California, Spain and Australia, each oriented at an angle of 120 degrees with each other and are spread onto three equidistant points on Earth as above so that at any 
Each location has ultra-sensitive receiver systems with huge antennas namely
* High Efficiency Antenna (HEF) for high gain (34m in diameter)
* Two or more Beam Waveguide Antennas (BWG) (34m in dia)

and several other independent antennas for tracking the spacecraft.
